## Street Vendor

# Overview

Here we developed a website on Street Vendors which will give them an online platform to communicate with their customers. Customers can easily find street vendors through our website. They can also see their products and product details. They can request specific vendors to have their contact information. The vendors can accept or deny the customer’s request.

# Description

The term “street vendor” in English is typically used interchangeably with “street trader,” “hawker,” and “peddler”. Conventionally, street vendors are those who sell their products without any built infrastructure customarily mobile in nature because they move from one area to another by carrying their wares on pushcarts or in baskets on their heads. There are over five lakh street hawkers in the country. For a population that seems to unanimously purchase products from hawkers and street vendors. Today, there are 107 hawker centers in the country which house about 15,000 stalls altogether. Usually, their locations are near to transportation hubs and public housing lands. When everything on internet available just a click away, physical shopping from vendors decreasing. 57.4% prefer to shop from online shops over street hawkers and 42.6% were in favor of shopping from the street hawkers. But this huge amount of people does not have any online platform. So in this project we will try to give them an online platform and also solve some of their problems through our website.

In this pandemic, people are advised for social distancing. The ongoing pandemic has locked the entire world inside homes but that does not mean the demands have gone from the market. People have to go to the market to buy daily necessaries. In the market it is very difficult to maintain any social distancing. Especially, when the street vendors gather around to sell their product. This causes health risk for both street vendors and customers. Through our website street vendors can go to the customer’s house to sell their product. They do not have to gather around. Customer do not have to go to the market. They also can easily buy their necessaries from the nearest street vendors. This helps social distancing.
